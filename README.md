# Responsive-Portfolio
## What was I supposed to be doing?
Retooling the sample portfolio pages using @media to scale elements on the page so they would look good on devices with smaller screens

## Technologies used:
* HTML
* CSS
* Media Queries

## What I did:
I took the pre-existing portfolio and applied 3 media tags to it and adjusted the styling within each one so that the page would match the sample pictures
